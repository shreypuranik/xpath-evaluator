# xpath-evaluator
A simple application to help evaluate xpaths

As a developer, when I need to build a web scraper, I never know if simple xpaths will work.

I wanted to build a read-to-use application that I can just feed a URL too, and a potential xpath, and see what the output is.

This application can be served from any server as long as it's got apache and PHP running.
