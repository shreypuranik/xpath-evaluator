# What is it?

A simple application to help evaluate xpaths

As a developer, when I need to build a web scraper, I never know if simple xpaths will work.

I wanted to build a read-to-use application that I can just feed a URL too, and a potential xpath, and see what the output is.

This application can be served from any server as long as it's got Apache and PHP running.

# Version 1.0

This was coded one Saturday evening, and uses PHP and file_get_contents to retrieve the initial HTML. Over time, I will be adding
more HTML retrieval methods, as well as amending the UI to allow you to select which method you use.

I'd love for it to look a bit more shiny than it is now, and so would love for you to submit a pull requests (hint hint! :D )

Please remember: Always ensure you have permission before scraping a site.
